# Mantle - ProctorU's Design System

Welcome to ProctorU's Design System Mantle

> MAAN-tuhl (noun) The mantle is the area of a bird's upperparts between the base of
its nape and its rump, between the shoulders and along the spine. In general,
the mantle is only the upper part of the back.

_[The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/bird-mantle-identification-385292)_

> Mantling is hunching, crouching, or arching shoulders and spreading wings
over a recent kill to conceal it from other birds and predators
who would be potential thieves.

robust and reusable components that can be used to craft elegant designs for ProctorU's internal
and external websites.

Its main purpose is to create developer happiness and designer pairity.
